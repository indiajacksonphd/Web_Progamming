Alright guys I'm finally done with ALL logic:

1) Start Here: locoalhost/Final_2/login.php
2) Click here to register
3) Come up with some fake name, click create, it adds the name to player.txt with a score of 0
4) A welcome message shows, click the link to go back to login
5) Enter your new name and click let's play
6) to the left is the Jeopardy board...each number loads an answer to the right
7) look to the right you will see you name, score, and a leader board
8) when you click on any number on the board, it loads a question (in the form of an answer) and the choices (in the form of questions) 
	to the right
9) When you click on an answer it tells you if you got the answer correct or incorrect. If it is incorrect, it gives you the correct
	answer and tells you how much you've lost. It updates your score and updates the leaderboard. If your'e correct, it tells you that you're correct, tells you how much you've won, updates your score and updates the leaderboard.
